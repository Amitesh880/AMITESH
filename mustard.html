                    <h1>Growing Conditions</h1>
                    <div class="box3">
                        <h3>Climate:</h3>
                        <h4>Temperature:</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Germination Stage:</strong> Mustard seeds require a soil temperature of around 10°C
                            to 15°C for optimal germination. Low soil temperatures below 5°C can delay or prevent
                            germination, while temperatures above 30°C can adversely affect it. <br>
                            <strong>Vegetative Growth Stage:</strong> During the vegetative phase, mustard prefers cool
                            temperatures between 10°C and 24°C. This range supports optimal leaf development and stem
                            growth. <br>
                            <strong>Reproductive Stage:</strong> As mustard transitions from vegetative growth to
                            reproductive stages (flowering and pod formation), slightly warmer temperatures (18°C to
                            24°C) are favorable. However, excessive heat, particularly temperatures above 30°C during
                            flowering, can lead to reduced pollination and pod formation. <br>
                            <strong>Harvest Stage:</strong> Warm and dry conditions are ideal during harvest, as they
                            help to ensure the mustard pods are mature and reduce the moisture content. This prevents
                            fungal diseases and spoilage during storage.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Rainfall and Moisture:</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Moderate Rainfall:</strong> Mustard requires moderate rainfall, generally between
                            300mm to 500mm per growing season. Rainfall distribution should be well-timed to ensure
                            sufficient moisture during key growth stages, such as germination and early vegetative
                            growth. <br>
                            <strong>Irrigation:</strong> In regions where rainfall is insufficient or irregular,
                            irrigation is crucial. It helps maintain adequate soil moisture, especially during critical
                            periods like flowering and pod filling. Over-irrigation, however, should be avoided to
                            prevent waterlogging and root diseases. <br>
                            <strong>Drought Resistance:</strong> Some mustard varieties are bred for drought resistance
                            and can tolerate dry conditions better. These varieties are particularly important in arid
                            and semi-arid regions.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Sunlight:</h4>
                        <p>Mustard requires full sunlight for at least 6 to 8 hours a day. Adequate sunlight is
                            essential for photosynthesis, which drives plant growth and development. <br> Cloudy and
                            overcast conditions, especially during critical growth phases, can reduce photosynthetic
                            activity and, consequently, pod yield.</p>
                        <h4>Humidity:</h4>
                        <p>Mustard prefers low to moderate humidity levels. High humidity can create favorable
                            conditions for fungal diseases such as white rust and powdery mildew, which can
                            significantly impact yield and quality. <br> Proper field management practices, like
                            maintaining adequate spacing between plants and timely application of fungicides, can help
                            manage disease pressure in high-humidity conditions.</p>
                        <h4>Wind:</h4>
                        <p>Mild winds can aid in pollination by helping to distribute pollen. However, strong winds can
                            cause lodging, where the mustard plants fall over, making harvesting difficult and reducing
                            yield. <br> Windbreaks or shelterbelts can be used to protect mustard fields from strong
                            winds, helping to maintain plant stability and health.</p>

                            <h4>Soil Type:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Loamy Soil:</strong> Mustard thrives best in loamy soils, which are a balanced
                                mixture of sand, silt, and clay. These soils provide good drainage while retaining
                                enough moisture for optimal growth. <br>
                                <strong>Clayey Soil:</strong> Clayey soils can also be suitable for mustard, provided
                                they are well-drained to prevent waterlogging. These soils have good nutrient retention
                                but may require proper management to ensure good aeration. <br>
                                <strong>Sandy Loam:</strong> Sandy loam soils, which are a mix of sand and loam, are
                                also favorable for mustard cultivation. They offer good drainage and ease of root
                                penetration but may require additional organic matter to improve nutrient content.
                            </p>
                            <img src="mustard_soil2.jpeg" style="align-self: center;" alt="">
                            <h4>Soil Structure:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Well-Drained:</strong> Mustard requires well-drained soil to prevent
                                waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and other diseases. Soil with good drainage
                                ensures that excess water is efficiently removed. <br>
                                <strong>Good Aeration:</strong> Proper soil aeration is essential for root respiration
                                and overall plant health. Well-aerated soils support vigorous root growth and nutrient
                                uptake.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Soil Fertility:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Nutrient-Rich:</strong> Mustard grows best in fertile soils with adequate levels
                                of essential nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and
                                micronutrients (e.g., zinc, iron, copper). <br>
                                <strong>Organic Matter:</strong> The presence of organic matter in the soil, such as
                                decomposed plant material or compost, enhances soil fertility by providing nutrients and
                                improving soil structure. Organic matter also supports beneficial soil microorganisms.
                            </p>
                            <img src="mustard_soil3.jpeg" alt="">
                            <h4>Soil pH:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Optimal pH Range:</strong> Mustard prefers a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH,
                                typically between 6.0 and 7.5. Soils outside this pH range may require amendments to
                                adjust the pH to an optimal level. <br>
                                <strong>pH Management:</strong> Lime (calcium carbonate) can be added to acidic soils to
                                raise the pH, while sulfur or organic matter can be used to lower the pH of alkaline
                                soils.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Soil Preparation:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Plowing and Tilling:</strong> Proper soil preparation involves plowing and
                                tilling to create a fine seedbed. This helps to improve soil structure, eliminate weeds,
                                and incorporate organic matter or fertilizers. <br>
                                <strong>Leveling:</strong> Leveling the field ensures uniform irrigation and prevents
                                waterlogging in low-lying areas. It also facilitates efficient planting and crop
                                management.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Soil Conservation:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Erosion Control:</strong> Practices such as contour plowing, terracing, and
                                maintaining ground cover help prevent soil erosion, which can deplete soil fertility and
                                structure. <br>
                                <strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotating mustard with other crops, such as legumes, can
                                improve soil health by reducing the buildup of pests and diseases and enhancing soil
                                nutrient levels through nitrogen fixation.
