                    <div class="box3">
                        <h3>Climate:</h3>
                        <h4>Temperature:</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Optimal Range:</strong> Tea plants prefer temperatures between 20°C to 30°C for optimal growth. <br>
                            <strong>Cold Tolerance:</strong> While tea can tolerate some cold, temperatures below 10°C can damage young leaves. <br>
                            <strong>Humidity:</strong> Tea thrives in humid conditions, ideally between 60% to 80%.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Rainfall and Moisture:</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Moderate Rainfall:</strong> Tea requires consistent rainfall, generally between 1,200mm to 2,500mm per year. <br>
                            <strong>Irrigation:</strong> In areas with insufficient rainfall, irrigation is necessary to maintain soil moisture, especially during dry periods. <br>
                            <strong>Drainage:</strong> Well-drained soil is crucial to prevent waterlogging, which can harm tea roots.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Sunlight:</h4>
                        <p>Tea plants require partial shade, ideally receiving 4 to 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. Adequate sunlight is essential for photosynthesis, which drives plant growth and leaf development.</p>
                        <h4>Soil:</h4>
                        <p>Tea prefers acidic soils with a pH range of 4.5 to 6. ```html
                            <strong>Soil Type:</strong> Well-drained, fertile soils with good aeration are ideal for tea cultivation. <br>
                            <strong>Organic Matter:</strong> Incorporating organic matter into the soil enhances its fertility and structure, supporting healthy root growth and nutrient uptake.

                            <p>
                                <strong>Plowing and Tilling:</strong> Proper soil preparation involves plowing and tilling to create a fine seedbed, improving soil structure, eliminating weeds, and incorporating organic matter or fertilizers. <br>
                                <strong>Leveling:</strong> Leveling the field ensures uniform irrigation and prevents waterlogging in low-lying areas, facilitating efficient planting and crop management.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Soil Conservation:</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Erosion Control:</strong> Practices such as contour plowing, terracing, and maintaining ground cover help prevent soil erosion, which can deplete soil fertility and structure. <br>
                                <strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotating tea with other crops, such as legumes, can improve soil health by reducing the buildup of pests and diseases and enhancing soil nutrient levels through nitrogen fixation.

                        <h4>General Water Needs:</h4>
                        <p>Tea requires approximately 1,200-2,500 millimeters (mm) of water throughout its growing season, depending on the variety, climate, and soil conditions.</p>
            
                        <h4>Critical Growth Stages:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Germination:</strong> Adequate soil moisture is necessary for seed germination and seedling establishment.<br>
                            <strong>Vegetative Stage:</strong> Water is crucial during the vegetative stage to promote leaf development and growth.<br>
                            <strong>Flowering:</strong> Adequate moisture at the flowering stage ensures proper flower and fruit development.<br>
                            <strong>Harvest Stage:</strong> Reducing irrigation towards the end of the growing season allows the soil to dry, facilitating harvesting and preventing lodging.
