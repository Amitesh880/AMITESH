                    <h1>Growing Conditions</h1>
                 <div class="box3">
                        <h3>Climate:</h3>
                        <h4>Temperature:</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Germination Stage:</strong> Pumpkin seeds require a soil temperature of around 18°C to 30°C for optimal germination. <br>
                            <strong>Vegetative Growth Stage:</strong> Prefers warm temperatures between 20°C and 30°C. <br>
                            <strong>Reproductive Stage:</strong> As pumpkins transition to reproductive stages, temperatures between 25°C to 35°C are favorable. <br>
                            <strong>Harvest Stage:</strong> Warm and dry conditions are ideal during harvest to ensure the pumpkins are mature and reduce moisture content, preventing spoilage.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Rainfall and Moisture:</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Moderate Rainfall:</strong> Pumpkins require moderate rainfall, generally between 500mm to 800mm per growing season. Rainfall distribution should be well-timed to ensure sufficient moisture during key growth stages. <br>
                            <strong>Irrigation:</strong> In regions where rainfall is insufficient, irrigation is crucial, especially during flowering and fruit development. Over-irrigation should be avoided to prevent waterlogging. <br>
                            <strong>Drought Sensitivity:</strong> Pumpkins are sensitive to drought, and consistent moisture is essential for optimal fruit size and quality.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Sunlight:</h4>
                        <p>Pumpkins require full sunlight for at least 6 to 8 hours a day. Adequate sunlight is essential for photosynthesis, which drives plant growth and fruit development. <br> Cloudy conditions can reduce photosynthetic activity and yield.</p>
                        <h4>Humidity:</h4>
                        <p>Pumpkins prefer moderate humidity levels. High humidity can create conditions favorable for fungal diseases, impacting yield and quality. <br> Proper field management practices can help manage disease pressure in high-humidity conditions.</p>
                        <h4>Wind:</h4>
                        <p>Mild winds can aid in pollination, but strong winds can cause lodging, making harvesting difficult. <br> Windbreaks can be used to protect pumpkin fields from strong winds, maintaining plant stability.</p>

                            <h3>Soil:</h3>
                            <h4>Soil Type:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Loamy Soil:</strong> Pumpkins thrive best in loamy soils, which provide good drainage while retaining moisture. <br>
                                <strong>Sandy Soil:</strong> Sandy soils are also favorable, offering good drainage and ease of root penetration. <br>
                                <strong>Clayey Soil:</strong> Clayey soils can be suitable if well-drained.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Soil Structure:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Well-Drained:</strong> Pumpkins require well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging. <br>
                                <strong>Good Aeration:</strong> Proper soil aeration is essential for root respiration and overall plant health.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Soil Fertility:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Nutrient-Rich:</strong> Pumpkins grow best in fertile soils with adequate levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients. <br>
                                <strong>Organic Matter:</strong> The presence of organic matter enhances soil fertility and supports beneficial microorganisms.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Soil pH:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Optimal pH Range:</strong> Pumpkins prefer a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH, typically between 6.0 and 7.0. <br>
                                <strong>pH Management:</strong> Lime can be added to acidic soils to raise the pH, while sulfur can be used to lower the pH of alkaline soils.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Soil Preparation:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Plowing and Tilling:</strong> Proper soil preparation involves plowing and tilling to create a fine seedbed. <br>
                                <strong>Leveling:</strong> Leveling the field ensures uniform irrigation and prevents waterlogging.
                            </ p>
                            <h4>Soil Conservation:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Erosion Control:</strong> Practices such as contour plowing and maintaining ground cover help prevent soil erosion. <br>
                                <strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotating pumpkins with other crops can improve soil health and reduce pest buildup.

                    <h1>Water Requirements:</h1>
                    <div class="box3">
                        <h4>General Water Needs:</h4>
                        <p>Pumpkins require a total of approximately 500-700 millimeters (mm) of water throughout their growing season, depending on the variety, climate, and soil conditions.</p>

                        <h4>Critical Growth Stages:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Germination:</strong> Adequate soil moisture is necessary for seed germination, typically requiring around 25-50 mm of water during this stage. <br>
                            <strong>Seedling Stage:</strong> Consistent moisture is crucial for young plants, needing about 50-75 mm of water to establish strong roots. <br>
                            <strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> During flowering, pumpkins require increased moisture, approximately 75-100 mm, to support fruit set and development. <br>
                            <strong>Fruit Development Stage:</strong> This stage is critical for yield, requiring around 100-150 mm of water to ensure proper fruit filling and maturation. <br>
                            <strong>Pre-Harvest Stage:</strong> Reducing water supply before harvest helps in drying the fruit, making them easier to pick and improving quality.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Drought and Stress Management:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Drought-Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant drought-resistant pumpkin varieties in regions prone to water scarcity. <br>
                            <strong>Deficit Irrigation:</strong> Implement strategies where water is applied during the most critical growth stages to manage water resources during drought conditions.
