 ```html
                            <strong>Erosion Control:</strong> Practices such as contour plowing, terracing, and maintaining ground cover help prevent soil erosion. <br>
                            <strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotating sugarcane with other crops can improve soil health by reducing pests and diseases and enhancing soil nutrient levels.

                    <h1>Water Requirements:</h1>
                    <div class="box3">
                        <h4>General Water Needs:</h4>
                        <p>Sugarcane requires approximately 1,000-2,500 millimeters (mm) of water throughout its growing season, depending on the variety, climate, and soil conditions.</p>
            
                        <h4>Critical Growth Stages:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Germination:</strong> Adequate soil moisture is necessary for seed germination and seedling establishment.<br>
                            <strong>Vegetative Stage:</strong> Water is crucial during the vegetative stage to promote leaf development and growth.<br>
                            <strong>Maturation Stage:</strong> Adequate moisture at the maturation stage ensures proper sugar accumulation and ripening.<br>
                            <strong>Harvest Stage:</strong> Reducing irrigation towards the end of the growing season allows the soil to dry, facilitating harvesting.
