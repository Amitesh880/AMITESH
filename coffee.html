                            <p>Coffee is a relatively sustainable crop, requiring less water compared to other crops.
                                However, its production can have environmental impacts, such as deforestation and water
                                pollution. Sustainable practices, such as shade-grown coffee and organic farming, can
                                help minimize these impacts.</p>
