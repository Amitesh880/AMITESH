                    <h1>Growing Conditions</h1>
                    <div class="box3">
                        <h3>Climate:</h3>
                        <h4>Temperature:</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Germination Stage:</strong> Chickpea seeds require a soil temperature of around 10°C to 30°C for optimal germination. Low soil temperatures below 5°C can delay germination. <br>
                            <strong>Vegetative Growth Stage:</strong> During the vegetative phase, chickpeas prefer warm temperatures between 15°C and 25°C. <br>
                            <strong>Reproductive Stage:</strong> As chickpeas transition to reproductive stages, temperatures between 20°C to 30°C are favorable . However, excessive heat above 35°C can adversely affect flowering and pod formation. <br>
                            <strong>Harvest Stage:</strong> Warm and dry conditions are ideal during harvest to ensure the chickpeas are mature and reduce moisture content, preventing spoilage.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Rainfall and Moisture:</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Moderate Rainfall:</strong> Chickpeas require moderate rainfall, generally between 300mm to 600mm per growing season. Rainfall distribution should be well-timed to ensure sufficient moisture during key growth stages. <br>
                            <strong>Irrigation:</strong> In regions where rainfall is insufficient, irrigation is crucial, especially during flowering and pod filling. Over-irrigation should be avoided to prevent root diseases. <br>
                            <strong>Drought Resistance:</strong> Chickpeas are known for their drought resistance and can tolerate dry conditions better than many other crops.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Sunlight:</h4>
                        <p>Chickpeas require full sunlight for at least 6 to 8 hours a day. Adequate sunlight is essential for photosynthesis, which drives plant growth and development. <br> Cloudy conditions can reduce photosynthetic activity and yield.</p>
                        <h4>Humidity:</h4>
                        <p>Chickpeas prefer low to moderate humidity levels. High humidity can create conditions favorable for fungal diseases, impacting yield and quality. <br> Proper field management practices can help manage disease pressure in high-humidity conditions.</p>
                        <h4>Wind:</h4>
                        <p>Mild winds can aid in pollination, but strong winds can cause lodging, making harvesting difficult. <br> Windbreaks can be used to protect chickpea fields from strong winds, maintaining plant stability.</p>

                                <strong>Well-Drained:</strong> Chickpeas require well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging. <br>
                                <strong>Good Aeration:</strong> Proper soil aeration is essential for root respiration and overall plant health.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Soil Fertility:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Nutrient-Rich:</strong> Chickpeas grow best in fertile soils with adequate levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients. <br>
                                <strong>Organic Matter:</strong> The presence of organic matter enhances soil fertility and supports beneficial microorganisms.

                            <p>
                                <strong>Optimal pH Range:</strong> Chickpeas prefer a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH, typically between 6.0 and 7.5. <br>
                                <strong>pH Management:</strong> Lime can be added to acidic soils to raise the pH, while sulfur can be used to lower the pH of alkaline soils.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Soil Preparation:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Plowing and Tilling:</strong> Proper soil preparation involves plowing and tilling to create a fine seedbed. <br>
                                <strong>Leveling:</strong> Leveling the field ensures uniform irrigation and prevents waterlogging.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Soil Conservation:</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Erosion Control:</strong> Practices such as contour plowing and maintaining ground cover help prevent soil erosion. <br>
                                <strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotating chickpeas with other crops can improve soil health and reduce pest buildup.

                                <h4>General Water Needs:</h4>
                                <p>Chickpeas require a total of approximately 300-500 millimeters (mm) of water throughout their growing season, depending on the variety, climate, and soil conditions.</p>

                                <h4>Critical Growth Stages:</h4>
                                <p><strong>Germination:</strong> Adequate soil moisture is necessary for seed germination and seedling establishment. <br>
                                    <strong>Tillering:</strong> Water is crucial during the tillering stage to promote the growth of additional tillers, which can lead to higher yields.<br>
                                    <strong>Flowering and Pod Filling:</strong> Irrigation during the flowering and pod filling stages is vital for achieving good pod size and weight.<br>
                                    <strong>Late Season:</strong> Reducing irrigation towards the end of the growing season allows the soil to dry, facilitating harvesting and preventing lodging.
